                <h4>About Duckstreet</h4>
                <p>
                    Duckstreet is a loveletter to all of the idle web games I grew up playing, but I always felt they either got way too complicated or didn't offer enough variety. The pixel-art style also holds a dear place in my heart and I think is a core part of what gives Duckstreet its charm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal was to create a game that was simple and relaxing to its core, but still had that feeling of infinite possibilities. I wanted you to be able to check in, see what new items you could find, and build a collection that felt truly unique!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, if I'm being honest... I just thought the idea of ducks on skateboards stealing each other's hats was really funny. I hope you have as much fun collecting them as I did making them! 
                </p>
